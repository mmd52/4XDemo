## Progress so Far

### Day1
* Data cleaned in excel and CSV realised
* Data cleaned in R and mini Library load Scripts Developed
* Regressions for main Cost drivers Run
> *Quick Conclusion-* Total cost of Distribution and Customer and order management costs can easily be predicted using COGS. However the problem lies with Operations cost and customer related Issue costs. Operations cost can be predicted using supply chain management costs, however none of our cost drivers can be used to predict supply chain management costs.
* The percentage option was a clear flop show!
* What to do find a way to get better R square for -
* * Operations cost
* * Customer Related Issue Costs
* Once this is done or partly done NF creating a error margin for all the predictions
* Adding all these prediction values
* Providing total cost with the help of graph
* *SHINY*
